This CSS style-sheet: custom.css, customizes the Magento Admin Panel. Enlarging the font-size makes the UI more suitable for larger screens. When spending much time making a web shop, I had the urge to make the Magento Admin Panel UI a bit prettier: better fonts, CSS-3 rounded corners to lose a bit of that “boxed-in-feel”, nicer colours, gradients and so on. And this I would like to share.
