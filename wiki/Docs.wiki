= How to best integrate {{{custom.css}}} in Magento =
One can easily be tempted to download this {{{custom.css}}} file and then directly overwrite the custom.css file in the {{{skin/adminhtml/default/default}}} directory. <br />  
Please *resist this urge*, you will regret this later, for it will not survive any updates of [http://www.magentocommerce.com/wiki/ Magento]. <br />  
The easiest way to build *_your own custom admin theme module_* in Magento is:
  # Download [http://inchoo.net/author/weiler/ Ivan Weiler’s]  {{{admintheme_example.rar}}} from [http://inchoo.net/ecommerce/magento/custom-admin-theme-in-magento/ inchoo.net]. 
  # Follow the instructions on [http://inchoo.net/ecommerce/magento/custom-admin-theme-in-magento/ this blog post]: where to copy the files.
  # Make also a custom theme folder in: {{{skin/adminhtml/default/}}}  -> *your-theme*
  # Copy the {{{custom.css}}} file to the *_your-theme_* folder; the one that you just created.
  # When done correctly a “Admin Theme” option will appear in Magento Admin Panel -> System -> Configuration -> General -> Design (Default Config scope). Just fill in the name of your theme there.

  * Create an images folder in *_your-theme_* folder. For the {{{custom.css}}} stylesheet I did swap some of the default UI icons with some fresher looking ones. They are from an iconset named [http://p.yusukekamiyamane.com/ Fugue icons], and made by Yusuke Kamiyamane: exceptionally well-thought-out and craftily executed icons.
